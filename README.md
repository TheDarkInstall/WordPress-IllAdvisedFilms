# WordPress-IllAdvisedFilms
www.illadvisedfilms.com

Note; this is currently in very early development.  Client initiated, but has not followed up since the basic site was installed.

Simple Wordpress install and mod, to clients graphical specifications, for a small independent film company in the UK.  Waiting for them to return...

To be created... (if / when client reappears!)

- Remove all WP branding
- Implement news feed style front page
- Nav bar with tabs, linking to various sections.
- Main media section, showcasing clients' work
- Work in progress section, showing current projects by client
- Contact / Employment section, with client displaying rates, conditions etc., for work.
- Shop, selling client and associated 3rd party media.
